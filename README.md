# Cryptology

A collection of cryptology challenges, papers and CTFs I completed during my studies.

## Cryptology
This folder contains Sage scripts to:
- Generate RSA keys, encrypt and decrypt a message
- Calculate RSA keys using the Chinese Remainder Theorem
- Factor using various methods, such as:
    - p-1
    - Pollard Rho
    - Coppersmith
- Diffie Hellman key generation
- Discrete log attacks:
    - Baby step giant step
    - Pollig-Hellman
    - Pollard Rho and Floyds
- Elliptic curves operations on:
    - Edwards
    - Twisted Edwards
    - Wierstrass
    - Montgomery
    - Birational equivalence

## Applied Cryptography

This folder is divided into CTF challenges and a paper I wrote, analyzing the cryptographical differences between Monero and Zcash, 2 privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies

## Multiparty Computation

This project contains the development of 4 different algorithms to securely merge 2 sorted arrays with the use of multi party computation. The report covers a discussion about the security and efficency of the algorithms.
